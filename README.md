# Shell Scripting Lab Programs

This repository contains 15 simple shell scripts for common programming lab tasks. Each script is named by its number (e.g., `1.sh`, `2.sh`, ..., `15.sh`).

## How to Run the Programs

1. **Open a terminal** and navigate to this folder.
2. **Run any script** using:

   ```bash
   bash <script-number>.sh
   ```

   Replace `<script-number>` with the number of the program you want to run. For example:
   - `bash 1.sh` (Basic shell navigation)
   - `bash 5.sh` (Find greatest of three numbers)
   - `bash 13.sh` (Simple calculator)

3. **Follow the on-screen instructions.** Some scripts will ask you to enter numbers or other input.

## What Each Script Does

1. **1.sh** – Basic shell navigation commands (directory and file creation demo)
2. **2.sh** – Print the system date and time
3. **3.sh** – Check if a number is zero, positive, or negative
4. **4.sh** – Check if a number is odd or even
5. **5.sh** – Find the greatest of three numbers
6. **6.sh** – Calculate mean and standard deviation of three numbers
7. **7.sh** – Calculate the sum of digits of a number
8. **8.sh** – Reverse a number
9. **9.sh** – Generate Fibonacci numbers up to a limit
10. **10.sh** – Find the factorial of a number
11. **11.sh** – Find the sum and average of numbers from command arguments
12. **12.sh** – Check if a number is prime
13. **13.sh** – Simple calculator (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
14. **14.sh** – Print "Good Morning" or "Good Evening" based on input hour
15. **15.sh** – Count the number of words and characters in a sentence

## Tips

- Make sure you have `bash` installed (default on most Linux/macOS systems).
- For calculator and standard deviation scripts, `bc` is used for decimal calculations.
- If you get a "Permission denied" error, use `bash <script>.sh` instead of `./<script>.sh`.

## Algorithms
